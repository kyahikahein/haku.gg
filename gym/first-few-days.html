    <h2>my first few days at gym</h2>
    <div class="blog-post">
      <p>okay, so… i officially became a gym person. well, kind of. more like a “newbie who doesn’t know what they’re doing but pretends they do.”</p>
      <p><strong>day 1:</strong></p>
      <p>walked in. immediately regretted it. everything looked huge, heavy, and intimidating. machines with buttons, weird levers, and weights that could probably crush a small car. i tried picking up a dumbbell—shake city. arms wobbling, legs weak, ego bruised. left feeling like i had just survived some kind of reality show challenge. soreness? already there. pride? also there, somehow.</p>
      <p><strong>day 2:</strong></p>
      <p>thought i’d be a little better. spoiler: i wasn’t. but i did figure out a couple of machines, and i lifted a slightly heavier dumbbell without dropping it. small victory! my legs were sore in places i didn’t know existed. honestly, walking felt like a new extreme sport.</p>
      <p><strong>day 3:</strong></p>
      <p>by now, my body is plotting against me. everything hurts, but weirdly, i kind of like it. i’m starting to understand the rhythm, and i actually feel like i’m accomplishing something. pull-ups are still a nightmare. squats? my legs scream “why??” every time. but that 5–10 minutes extra on the treadmill? feels like a medal-winning performance.</p>
      <p>moral of the story so far: the gym is awkward, confusing, and painful, but showing up every day—even if you look like a fool—is progress. and honestly, those little victories feel bigger than they look.</p>
      <p>here’s to more sweat, soreness, and small wins. because apparently these kind of small daily wins are what we all live for.</p>
